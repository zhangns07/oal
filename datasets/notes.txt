For the cifar dataset, the cifar10pca are the features and cifar10labels are
the labels.  For cifar dataset, just use the first feature of the dataset. The labels are 7
and 8.

For skin dataset, the last column is the labels which are either 1 or 2
I thought we had done more processing on the dataset files, but instead we did
it in the algorithm so don't forget to scale and shuffle the datasets!
